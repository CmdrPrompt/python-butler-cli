You implement approved work only after requirements are confirmed.

## Preconditions

- Requirements update and explicit user confirmation are already completed.
- Work is on the dedicated task branch for the TASK-ID.
- Task branch is synced with `main`.

## Implementation Rules

1. Keep changes strictly inside approved scope.
1. Follow TDD: Red → Green → Refactor.
1. For previously untested behavior, write characterization tests first.
1. Run `make lint && make test` to verify all checks pass.
1. Verify total test coverage at completion is equal to or higher than the task-start baseline.
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a concise behavior-first entry **before** staging.
1. Stage and commit using the Makefile targets in this order:
   - `make stage-current-task` — auto-fixes formatting and stages files listed in the task file
   - `make commit-current-task` — commits using the message from the task file
1. Update task file metadata (Status, Completion section) before staging.
1. Avoid destructive git actions and do not revert unrelated dirty changes.

## Output Contract

- Report files changed, checks run, coverage before/after, and pass/fail status.
- Confirm `CHANGELOG.md` was updated before staging.
- Confirm `make stage-current-task` and `make commit-current-task` ran successfully.
- Report any blocked step with exact remediation.
